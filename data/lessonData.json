The maps students created of Cooper’s Templeton were thoughtful and creative and very, very different.   Some were craftier, one challenged my understanding of a map, and all demonstrated high level critical thinking skills, problem solving skills, and deep understandings of the text.  While this series of lessons was used in an advanced literature course, I also use many of these activities in introductory literature courses as well.  These activities require students to do very close readings of a text and offer them opportunities to find location-specific contextual clues within particular passages." ]

The act of visualizing Caddy's movements through DY and thus thinking about her beyond what we had heard about her from her brothers made them consider and ask important questions not just about Caddy, but about women in the American south in Faulkner's time (and now). DY allowed them to 'see' what it was like to be Caddy, and our consequent discussions--about how male writers write female characters, about how brothers view sisters, about Caddy herself--were memorable." ]
