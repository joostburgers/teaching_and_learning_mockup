					<p>Since each member of the Bundren family in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> has a different view of what it means to be a “family,” we will build a genealogy that changes with the characters as the story unfolds.  The following three exercises build on one another, but you can stop at any point.</p>
					<p>
						After an in-class discussion of Faulkner’s character genealogies, each student will create a one-slide visual representation of the Bundren family as it appears to one character at one point in time in the narrative. The student will write a short “tombstone” or wall description (as you might see in a museum) to accompany the slide, explaining their aesthetic and analytic choices, and including textual support.  After the instructor collates the slides into a single PowerPoint, students will take turns presenting their image to the class, after which the class can compare their approaches and the many Bundren conceptions of "family."

								<p>
									Faulkner created multiple genealogies of his major families throughout his career. The interactive genealogies commentary represents the people and patterns in Faulkner's major families dynamically as he created and revised kinship patterns.
								</p>
								<p>
									All of the families in the genealogies are those that recur in at least four texts and over at least three generations. Due to this editorial principle, the Bundrens, who for the most part only appear in <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, do not have a genealogy on the Digital Yoknapatawpha site.

								<li>There is no DY representation of the Bundren family genealogy, since it appears in only one Faulkner text. But what we know of the Bundren genealogy changes over the course of the novel, as we shift character perspectives and learn more family secrets. What would the Bundren family genealogy look like as it is revealed for <em>As I Lay Dying</em></li>
								<li>What types of tools are appropriate for analyzing this novel?</li>
								<li>How does the fluid representation of kinship in <em>As I Lay Dying</em> make us newly aware of genealogies as constructed documents?</li>
								<li>Do Faulkner's different genealogies speak to their seriousness or do the constant revisions reveal a critique of genealogy as a scholarly practice?</li>

								<li>What does The Bundren Family genealogy depicted here tell us about the point in time or point of view from which the family tree is constructed?  What are the values reflected in this genealogy?  Are they shared by Faulkner’s characters?</li>
									<li>How do we depict marital and extra-marital relationships? </li>
									<li>Does the usual emphasis on progeny and patriarchy capture a given character’s way of building meaning in his or her life? </li>
									<li>Is birth order the right way of signaling a child’s relationship with parents and siblings? </li>
									<li>Can an individual flee the family tree? </li>
									<li>Are all characters clear on the distinction between people and property? Are there ways of indicating relationships that don’t slide into proprietary claims? (“This is my child” is grammatically indistinguishable from “This is my chocolate.”) </li>
									<li>Where does Addie go when she dies? Does she remain visible in your representation of the family? </li>
									<li>Are you linking people to people? people to animals? people to land? Are you highlighting social, moral, aesthetic, or political relationships, or something else entirely? </li>
