			<p> This lesson plan uses the coming of age theme as an entry point into William Faulkner’s “Barn Burning'' through which students can begin to explore the historical and cultural context of Yoknapatawpha County. In pairing “Barn Burning” with Richard Wright’s “The Man Who Was Almost a Man,” students will compare two stories of adolescent boys confronted with the socio-economic and racial barriers presented by Jim Crow era sharecropping. Both Sarty’s and Dave’s coming of age stories will be presented as opportunities to analyze how a economic institution like sharecropping can constrain individuals based on race and class.</p>

			<ul class="activity-list-unordered">
				<li>In studying the history of sharecropping, we learned that sharecropping as an economic institution in the South enforced a socio-economic class divide and exacerbated racial inequities during the era of Jim Crow segregation. For this response, compare how Faulkner and Wright depict the impact of sharecropping on class and racial division in their respective stories. How does the class divide and racial discrimination impact both young protagonists, Dave and Sarty, as they attempt to assert themselves as individuals? How might these institutional barriers shape how they try to find autonomy and react to the adversity that they both face? Focus on core similarities while also exploring how their different racial identities and ages give context to the different decisions they make as they come of age in the story. Consider the similar endings to the stories. Why do you think it is significant that they both flee their farms at the end of their stories? </li>
