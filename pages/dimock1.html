				<p> This lesson plan uses the coming of age theme as an entry point into William Faulkner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Barn Burning&rdquo; through which students can begin to explore the historical and cultural context of Yoknapatawpha County. In pairing &ldquo;Barn Burning&rdquo; with Richard Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Man Who Was Almost a Man,&rdquo; students will compare two stories of adolescent boys confronted with the socio-economic and racial barriers presented by Jim Crow era sharecropping. Both Sarty&rsquo;s and Dave&rsquo;s coming of age stories will be presented as opportunities to analyze how an economic institution like sharecropping can constrain individuals based on their race and class.</p>

							<div class="activity-instructions">
								<p>Digital Yoknapatawpha has a curated collection of photographs from different archives. The photos can either be viewed by archive or by the location where the photo was taken.</p>
								<p>The majority of the photos from the Library of Congress archive were taken in the 1930s by photographers working for the Farm Security Administration. They tend to focus on the lives of non-white and poor white Mississippi sharecroppers.</p>
								<p> Although Faulkner set his story in the 1890s, the system of sharecropping only changed slightly with the introduction of new technologies. The pictures are therefore fairly representative of what sharecroppers and their communities would have looked like when both Faulkner and Wright wrote their stories.</p>

					<li>In studying the history of sharecropping, we learned that sharecropping as an economic institution in the South enforced a socio-economic class divide and exacerbated racial inequities during the era of Jim Crow segregation.

					<li>How does the class divide and racial discrimination impact both young protagonists, Dave and Sarty, as they attempt to assert themselves as individuals?</li>
