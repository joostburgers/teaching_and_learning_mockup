				<p> This lesson plan uses the coming of age theme as an entry point into William Faulkner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Barn Burning'' through which students can begin to explore the historical and cultural context of Yoknapatawpha County. In pairing &ldquo;Barn Burning&rdquo; with Richard Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Man Who Was Almost a Man,&rdquo; students will compare two stories of adolescent boys confronted with the socio-economic and racial barriers presented by Jim Crow era sharecropping. Both Sarty&rsquo;s and Dave&rsquo;s coming of age stories will be presented as opportunities to analyze how an economic institution like sharecropping can constrain individuals based on their race and class.</p>

								<p>All of these photos come from the Library of Congress and depict the lives of Mississippi sharecroppers in the 1930s.
