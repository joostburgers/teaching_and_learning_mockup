								<li>Is the story told chronologically?</li>

								<li>Is there a pattern when Emily asserts “control” throughout the chronological timeline? How might the presentation skew your perception of her agency?</li>
								<li>How might Faulkner's placement of events on the timeline (contrasting chronological order with page order) reflect the struggle between tradition and modernization in the story?</li>

                            <div class="activity-comment">It is not clear what you mean with questions two and three on the list. More to the point, I'm failing to see the relationship between non-linear storytelling and Emily's aversion to progress. I think I see where you're going, but can you clarify this question in some way. What is the answer you are looking for and how does this question get you there? I'm not sure you can see Emily "asserting control from the provided timeline. Can you clarify what you mean here?</div>

                                        The Great Migration was a mass movement in which millions of African Americans relocated from the rural South to urban areas in the Northeast, Midwest, and West in the early 20th century. Driven by factors including racial violence, segregation, and better economic opportunities in industrial cities, this mass exodus fundamentally reshaped American demographics and culture.

                            <p>Digital Yoknapatawpha’s tools allow users to generate visual representations of social relations in each text, which you  will utilize to think critically about the representations of race, class, and gender in Faulkner’s fiction.</p>
                            <p>This activity produces visualizations illustrating how the town of Jefferson interacts with Emily, even if she is isolated. It also focuses on the centering of white upper-class characters and the relative marginalization of Black characters. The activity is to encourage you to better understand the limits of Faulkner’s fiction as historical representation.</p>

                                        This graph shows how often characters are present or mentioned in the same event. A red line (<span class="red-line"></span>) between two blue boxes (<span class="blue-node"></span>) shows at least one interaction, and a thicker line indicates multiple interactions. Characters with more connections are closer to the center, but, importantly, the position of characters are not fixed.

                                        Characters who appear close together in one graph may appear far apart in another. The graph is interactive, so you can click on a character’s name to see their connections. You can also click and drag characters to reposition them.
