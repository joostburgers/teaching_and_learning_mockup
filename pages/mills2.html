						<h2 class="content_sub_title">Everyone Told Me: Don't Even Try to Teach The Sound and the Fury to High Schoolers</h2>
						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								The experience of reading a Faulkner novel is at once glorious, mind-expanding, intellectually rich—and exasperating. Faulkner is, of course, delightfully difficult to comprehend, and with his complexities come my ultimate challenge as a teacher: how do I imbue young people with my enthusiasm for this great writer, when his writing can be so hard to understand? When I was given the opportunity to teach a Junior/Senior advanced elective at the all-boys high school where I work, I knew at once that I would teach <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>. I loved the novel more than any other: why wouldn't the kids feel the same way? But when I started to talk to colleagues about it, their skeptical looks and rolling eyes made me question whether I could keep teenagers locked in on this difficult novel. Where would I even start?
							</p>
							<p>
								Until the advent of Digital Yoknapatawpha, as readers and teachers, our interaction with the people and the places in Faulkner's stories was limited to his brilliance, the brilliance of the interpretations of others, our imaginations, and the black lines of type (and sometimes an odd eyeball) on the page. We had to muddle our way through, often with little guidance or guidance mostly available at scholarly conferences. But now we have DY. DY is a portal, a data-driven parallel universe that allows us to travel to Yoknapatawpha County and look around for ourselves in ways that we haven't been able to in the past. And having access to this lens, particularly when we are trying to understand characters in Faulkner's universe who are occluded or less visible, can bring them into clear focus and deepen our understanding of them.
							</p>

					<!-- TEACHING BEFORE DY SECTION -->
					<section class="essay-section" id="teaching-before-dy">
						<h2 class="content_sub_title">Teaching Faulkner Before I Knew About DY</h2>
						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								When I first started teaching <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> in my Southern American Literature class, I created instructive slideshows about Benjy, about Quentin, about Jason, and about Dilsey. But I did not create a slideshow about Caddy, even though she is, as Faulkner admits, his "heart's darling" and arguably the main character in the novel. One day I looked through my slide decks and wondered why: in trying to teach this novel, why wasn't I giving Caddy the same attention as I was giving her brothers and Dilsey? And why didn't Faulkner do the same?
							</p>
							<p>
								I wanted to figure out how to get my class to think about Caddy more fully, to try to get inside her head, to think about how we can know a character when they don't have a voice or when they don't have much of an identity outside the views of their brothers or other characters, who may be unreliable at best. I wanted them to consider how few of Faulkner's women communicate through first-person perspective or stream-of-consciousness narrative. With the notable exceptions of Addie, Dewey Dell, and Joanna Burden, Faulkner's women are rarely portrayed alone and even less frequently does Faulkner speak from their perspective. I wanted my students to notice this and to question why. Were women valued by Faulkner but too inscrutable or too difficult to write? Or was it something else?
							</p>
							<p>
								I wanted them to also think about the other women that they read in Faulkner and other southern literature, and I wanted them to think about how effective or ineffective writers can be in capturing the truth of their characters. Minnie in "Dry September" and Emily in "A Rose for Emily," Judith and Ellen and Rosa in <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> — all of these women are fascinating, yet mostly what we know of them is hearsay or gossip or presupposed by a male in their life.
							</p>
							<p>
								In class, of course, I could put all of these questions on the board. But DY made me think of questions that I had never thought of, and it gave me a resource that allowed me and my students to open our laptops and click buttons and SEE things that we just couldn't see when we flipped Faulkner's pages.
							</p>
						</div>

					<!-- LITERATURE AS DATA SECTION -->
					<section class="essay-section" id="literature-as-data">
						<h2 class="content_sub_title">Literature As Data</h2>
						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								The concept of digital humanities is a unique one for most high school students; they furrow their brows when given the suggestion that somehow, a novel is full of data that scholars "calculate" and aggregate and which can be mined. The resources available on DY are many and varied and all accessible to anyone who wanders into the site. My class's collective exploration of DY begins when we have finished the first three chapters of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, after they have already read several Faulkner short stories, including "A Rose for Emily" and "Dry September" and multiple short stories by writers such as Eudora Welty, Flannery O'Connor, Alice Walker, and Zora Neale Hurston.
							</p>
							<p>
								By this time in the course, they have noticed some common themes — the role of gossip in the small southern town, the art of describing a climactic moment by having it take place "offscreen," the idea of personal odyssey, the South's fixation with the past — and they have made their way through the Benjy and Quentin sections. These become the tethers that ground them and help them understand. They have finished the Jason chapter and uniformly hate him. And they are hopeful that the Dilsey chapter will bring everything together in a way that feels satisfying. And it is at this moment we pause as a class and ask: what about Caddy? Why doesn't Caddy have a chapter?
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>

					<!-- FINDING CADDY SECTION -->
					<section class="essay-section" id="finding-caddy">
						<h2 class="content_sub_title">Finding Caddy with DY</h2>
						
						<h3 class="content_sub_title activity-title-blank" id="cumulative-character-search">Cumulative Character Search</h3>
						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								DY has identified 3,724 unique characters who appear in one or multiple Yoknapatawpha fictions, 80 of which have been categorized as "major". Beginning with DY's Cumulative Character search, my class starts to play around with the DY tool, selecting "female" as gender and "first person" as narrator, then selecting "female" and "Stream of Consciousness", then "female" and "major." When they change gender, or add race, what they discover quickly is that though there are quite a few male characters who speak to us directly from the thoughts in their minds, Faulkner does not typically write from the mind of the main female character, with the notable exception of Addie Bundren.
							</p>
							<p>
								This is the first of many "ah ha" moments that the class experiences as they explore DY. The questions are many: does Faulkner dislike women? Does he misunderstand them? Is he showing respect by not attempting to presume to know how they might think, even when they are people that he himself has invented?
							</p>
						
						</div>

						<h3 class="content_sub_title activity-title-blank" id="considering-women">Considering Women by Listening to Men</h3>
						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								The next step in the class is to pause for a moment and consider just the idea of women in Faulkner works and in the South and southern literature. We read Diane Roberts' 2016 article on Lilian Smith titled <em>Stay and Resist</em> in <em>The Oxford American</em>, where she examines Lillian Smith's criticism of Faulkner, including the quote where Smith says: "There is no future in [his] books. He never wrote about his equals. He has created no decent women; he loathes females and it shows in his work."
							</p>
							<p>
								We then consider Jesmyn Ward's 2011 commentary on Faulkner as told to Elizabeth Hoover in an interview for <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/08/30/jesmyn-ward-on-salvage-the-bones/"><em>The Paris Review</em></a>:
							</p>
							<blockquote class="activity-quote-epigraph">
								<p>The first time I read <em>As I Lay Dying</em>, I was so awed I wanted to give up. I thought, "He's done it, perfectly. Why the hell am I trying?" But the failures of some of his black characters—the lack of imaginative vision regarding them, the way they don't display the full range of human emotion, how they fail to live fully on the page—work against that awe and goad me to write.</p>
								<footer class="activity-quote-epigraph-footer">Jesmyn Ward, <cite>"Jesmyn Ward on <em>Salvage the Bones</em>." <a href="https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2011/08/30/jesmyn-ward-on-salvage-the-bones/"><em>The Paris Review</em></a>, 2011</cite></footer>
							</blockquote>
							<p>
								As we think about how a writer like Ward can be both inspired by Faulkner and aware of his limitations writing black characters (and relatedly female characters), the class feels both distanced from the intricate details of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em> itself and appreciative of the space to think through these higher-level ideas. After listening to audio clips available on the DY site, including Faulkner commenting about "how we should feel" about Caddy and why she doesn't have her own chapter, more questions arise.
							</p>
							<p>
								Hearing in Faulkner's own southern drawl his intention of "using the proper tools" to "draw the picture of Caddy" raises the biggest literary question of the class: what, exactly, are those tools? How can you create a "major" character whose internal mind we are kept out of? When we compare how we learn about the other characters, particularly her brothers, there are some notable distinctions: Benjy and Quentin are trapped in their thoughts or their sensory reactions, Jason is trapped by his resentment and powerlessness, but Caddy is entrapped, at least when she is younger, by her family's perceptions of her. Using DY to compare how we learn about other characters exposes us to something in the novel that we can feel but can't see: Caddy, the character the other characters are fixated on, has an extremely limited voice in 320+ pages of words.
							</p>
						</div>

						<h3 class="content_sub_title activity-title-blank" id="always-lonely">Always Lonely, Never Alone</h3>
					<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								Using the data available in DY gives us the means to get out of our own heads - where Faulkner regularly pushes us - and examine queries quantitatively. DY data can be used to generate graphs, such as one that tracks the number of times each character appears alone. We know the answers here, but seeing them satisfies any of our own second-guessing: Quentin is of course alone for much of our time with him, appearing by himself in 50 distinct events. Jason is sometimes alone, Dilsey is sometimes alone, Benjy is even sometimes alone. But Caddy is never alone.
							</p>
							<!-- Character Appearances Alone Chart -->
							<div id="chart-character-alone" style="width:100%;height:400px;">

							<div class="row">
								<div class="col">
							<p>
								Recognizing this, then, we then ask: if Caddy is never alone, then who is she with? Who are her friends? Using the Visuals section of DY, we can create character-character force-directed graphs. Assuming, stereotypically, that any young white upper-class girl in Jefferson, MS is most likely to spend her time with other young white upper-class girls, we can create a graph that shows just how many white upper-class girls Caddy actually knows. The answer, though, is: none. The resulting graph illustrates that the only women Caddy spends real time with are Caroline Compson, Damuddy, and (Miss) Quentin — all her family.

							</div>
							</div>
							
							<p>
								When the students in my class see on a graph that Caddy has no friends her age, they sometimes audibly gasp. They have not met any "friends" of Caddy's, beyond the boyfriends, in their reading, but they are still struck by the decided lack of peers the character-character force-directed graph suggests. Teenagers themselves, this is a state of being that they cannot imagine. And again, DY proves that it is one thing to read and try to understand, but it is yet another thing to see something on a graph and actually understand.
							</p>
							<p>
								Relatedly, a Narrative Status graph (see below, but note: this is a graph that currently only the behind-the-scenes masters of the DY data can generate, but it is yet another illustration of the power of the data entered in DY) measures how often we learn about a character based on the mode of narration.</p>  
								<ul class="activity-list-unordered">
									<li><em>Narrated</em> - third- or first-person narrator</li>
									<li><em>Remembered</em> - readers are seeing the event as a character is remembering it in his/her mind</li>
									<li><em>Told</em> - character in the novel or story is telling the event to other(s)</li>
									<li><em>Hypothesized</em> - a character or characters are constructing a possible version of what happened</li>
									
									<li><em>Narration + consciousness</em> - when Faulkner combines third-person and stream-of-consciousness narrative. </li>
								</ul>
								<p>
								This shows us, again, what we already know but in a way that is truly illuminating: what we understand about Caddy comes almost primarily from the memories of the other characters in the story. This all begs the question: do we actually know anything at all about her?					</p>
							<!-- Narrative Status Chart -->

						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<div class="row">
								<div class="col">
							<p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
								The Events Search on DY is the most illuminating feature on the site, and the feature that we as a class spend the most time with. Mapping movements and mapping locations of events in Faulkner stories is as interesting as using the Events Search to track timelines. So often, the data shows, characters are "stuck"; their movements are limited even as their thoughts race through time. Benjy is a fascinating start to an exploration of the Events Search feature. When you choose Benjy and then "present" his Events map, his mental and physical confinement is crystal clear. As we know from the novel, he moves around the perimeter of the Compson place, in and out of the house, venturing seldom anywhere else except occasionally into town. At the same time, his mind travels wildly and widely from the present to the far past to the near past.

									</div>
								</div>
							</div>
						   
							<p>
								Using Benjy's Events maps as a standard, as a class we then look at the Events maps of Caddy, Jason, Quentin, and
								Caroline Compson, showing quite clearly that when it comes to movement, the women in the novel have much less of it
								than the men. Again, the questions dominate the class discussion: why is this true? After noting Caddy's confinement
								in particular, we then do a Cumulative Characters Search: this shows that, after <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>
								(and into the Appendix), Caddy's motion accelerates considerably as she spends time at the Compson Place and then in
								Hollywood, Indiana, Mexico, and Paris. This visual representation of Caddy's movements affirms the analysis that
								many students have realized: Caddy, in Jefferson, feels so trapped that when circumstances release her, she flees to
								points on all corners of the world.

					<!-- CONCLUSION SECTION -->
					<section class="essay-section" id="conclusion">
						<h2 class="content_sub_title">DY Changed Everything For Me and My Classes </h2>
						<div class="activity-instructions">
							<p>
								I do not exaggerate when I say that in the years that I have been using DY as a tool in our high school study of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, the class has been transformed. Even the simple idea that novels can be divided into data points is eye-opening for students. But, more, the opportunity for "hands-on" reading, the gift of the visualization of aspects of the novel that students suspect but still question, and the value of a tool that lets us look more closely at a character we think we understand but maybe don't, enriches the questions students ask and the answers they deduce. DY allows them to "see" things that are hard to grasp through Faulkner's writing. When it comes time to write analytically, students, after our work together with DY, often choose to spend more time thinking about Caddy. They have fun writing a few pages of her chapter for a creative assignment, but they also feel more comfortable speculating about what she might be thinking and what might be motivating her actions.
							</p>
							<p>
								When we turn the page to the Dilsey chapter, my class is remarkably more confident than they were even during the Jason chapter, when the narrative finally felt more linear and understandable than the complexities they faced with Quentin and Benjy. They have learned, through DY, to look at Caddy from all points around her. Thinking about how Faulkner chooses to present her makes them then think about the other characters in a more adeptly analytical way. And it makes them think about characters in our successive readings — in Jesmyn Ward's <em>Sing, Unburied, Sing</em>, or Robert Penn Warren's <em>All the King's Men</em>, or even Pat Conroy's <em>Lords of Discipline</em>, in a way that reveals their inner English scholar.
							</p>
							<p>
								DY reaffirms to them that they should not accept what is written as absolute truth, but rather that their true understanding of <em>The Sound and the Fury</em>, or any other story, relies on them wondering why the author has chosen to tell us what he has told us in the way that he has told us. Instead of feeling frustrated by not understanding, they feel empowered by the questions that they can now identify. These moments, when a student stops in his analytical tracks because he just figured out something that he never thought he would figure out, are that "one matchless time" that all of us as teachers seek. Thank you, DY.
