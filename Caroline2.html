    <h1> Uncle Willy Lesson Plans</h1>

<h3>Using the Map tool, answer the following questions</h3>
<ul>
    <li> Why would California seem appealing to a 60 year old drug addict? Verus, why is it appealing for the character of Uncle Willy? Is there a difference?</li>
    <li> The Keely- how does the fact that both Faulkner's father and grandfather were treated for alcoholism here as well Uncle Willy, impact how we might view the character of Uncle Willy? </li>
    <li> Unnamed Narrator- how does his unchanging age and mindset about Uncle Willy mirror some of Uncle Willy’s mannerisms? </li>
    <li> Mrs. Merridew- from a glass of lemonade to rebirth, why is Mrs. Merridew not stopped in her attempts to “save” Uncle Willy? </li>
</ul>

<h3> In Class activity, use the Location and Charcter graph to expand on the differences between the main characters and how those differences help further the plot.  </h3>
<ul> 
   <li>How does the differences of class affect the characters efforts to (change the narrative/ or change the town)? Merridew as “lower class” and Willy and Narrator and “middle”, trying to work to change-> to try to get that class change? </li>  
   <li> Does the ratio of major men to women characters in this narrative hold any significance in how Faulkner chooses to push the plot?</li>
</ul>

<h3> Lastly, reflect on the context of the text by going through the About Text in person after reading the story, either do a class discussion or a written response to the questions. </h3>

<ul>
    <li> How does Faulkner's own desperate need for money despite being successful connect to the themes narrative? </li>
    <li> How is Faulkner an addict in that image? How is addiction different from living? Is trying to get uncle willy clean doing more harm than good after 40 years of dependences? </li>
    <li> How is the importance of Uncle Willy’s drug story in The Town (1957), allowing readers to reinstate the significance of Uncle Willy's presence in keeping his community together in this narrative?</li>
</ul>

<hi> Lion Lesson Plan</hi>
<h3> Using the Map, work together in groups to answer the following questions with quotes to support your claims. Present your answers and evidence to the class. </h3>
<ul>
    <li> What is the significance of the majority of the plot taking place outside of the main town?  </li>
    <li> Boon- how does Boon being perceived as mixed race affect how his actions are interpreted by the others?    </li>
    <li> Hunting camp- what sense of community does this camp inspire? Why is it significant that Lion’s final hours were there?    </li>
    <li> Holly Knoll- what does the imagery of Lion’s grave being washed away evoke in the reader? Is this a generation call to forgetting life lessons? Or is it washing away sins?    </li>
</ul>
<h3> Using the About the Text section, use your best interpretation of the information to answer the following questions.</h3>
<ul> 
    <li> What could Faulkners numerous rewrites from different perspectives give more insight to without reading it? </li>
    <li> How does having an outside views differ from being there in the moment?     </li>
    <li> How is the vagueness of the dating of the narrative significant to the message Faulkner is trying to get across?    </li>
</ul>
<h3> Use this as a homework assignment after reading Lion. Use the Location-Character Graph to help visual and elaborate on the following questions.</h3>
<ul> 
    <li> What does the lack of women in the story demonstrate to the readers? +  What role does masculinity place in the narrative?    </li>
    <li> How does the lower class versus upper class stereotype lead the others in their interpretation of one another? Does different classes' perspectives allow different views on the death of Lion?    </li>
</ul>
