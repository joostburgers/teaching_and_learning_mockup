    <h1>Elly: Navigating the Pitfalls of Modernity</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This lesson focuses primarily on William Faulkner's short story "Elly," with connections to "A Rose for Emily" and broader modernist themes. The plan is structured in three distinct parts, with the majority of time devoted to analyzing "Elly" itself, followed by comparative connections to "A Rose for Emily," and concluding with an examination of how both stories exemplify modernist literature.</p>
    
    <h2>Essential Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How does modernity function as both a liberator and a prison for Elly?</li>
        <li>How do technological changes, particularly the automobile, influence agency and social dynamics?</li>
        <li>How does Faulkner's representation of race complicate our understanding of Southern society?</li>
        <li>In what ways are women's options constrained by social expectations in Faulkner's South?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyze how modernity creates both opportunities and pitfalls for Elly</li>
        <li>Examine the role of technology as both enabler and destroyer in the narrative</li>
        <li>Evaluate the ambiguous treatment of race in Faulkner's characterization of Paul</li>
        <li>Recognize connections between "Elly" and "A Rose for Emily" as explorations of women in Southern society</li>
        <li>Identify characteristics of modernist literature in Faulkner's work</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Lesson Structure</h2>
    
    <h3>PART I: Deep Dive into "Elly"</h3>
    
    <h4>Beginning Activity</h4>
    <p>Opening Salvo: "How do Elly's 'modern' attitudes toward relationships and personal freedom both help and harm her throughout the story?"</p>
    
    <h4>Analyzing Elly's Character and Choices</h4>
    <p>Guided analysis:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Elly's relationship with her grandmother</li>
        <li>Her attitudes toward sexuality and relationships</li>
        <li>Her manipulation of multiple men</li>
        <li>Her ultimate decision regarding Paul</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Discussion questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How does Elly's sense of entitlement shape her decisions?</li>
        <li>What motivates Elly's actions throughout the story?</li>
        <li>How is Elly both empowered and constrained by her social position?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>The Role of Technology and Modernity</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Examine the DY heatmap of "Elly"</li>
        <li>Analyze the narrative structure and emotional intensity points</li>
        <li>Focus on the car as a symbol:</li>
        <li>Discussion: "Is the automobile a symbol of freedom or danger for Elly? Or both?"</li>
        <li>How does this technology specifically enable the story's central events?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>The Ambiguity of Race</h4>
    <p>Text analysis focused on Paul:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Examine specific descriptions of Paul in the text</li>
        <li>Discussion: "What textual evidence suggests Paul's race? Why might Faulkner keep this ambiguous?"</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Critical thinking questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How would different racial readings of Paul affect our interpretation of the story?</li>
        <li>What does Elly's grandmother's reaction to Paul reveal about Southern racial attitudes?</li>
        <li>How does class intersect with race in this story?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>PART II: Connecting "Elly" to "A Rose for Emily"</h3>
    
    <h4>Comparative Character Analysis</h4>
    <p>Venn diagram activity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In pairs, students create a Venn diagram comparing Emily and Elly</li>
        <li>Focus on family dynamics, romantic relationships, and societal constraints</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Class discussion:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How are Emily's father and Elly's grandmother similar as controlling forces?</li>
        <li>How do both women respond differently to patriarchal/matriarchal control?</li>
        <li>Emily was trapped in the past, Elly, the future. How do these different temporal orientations affect their choices?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Narrative Structure Comparison</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Compare DY heatmaps of both stories:</li>
        <li>How does the narrative structure differ between the stories?</li>
        <li>What effect does this have on reader perception?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Discussion:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How does Faulkner use different narrative techniques to achieve similar thematic goals?</li>
        <li>How are both stories concerned with the consequences of resistance to social norms?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>PART III: Faulkner and Modernism</h3>
